# NaNoWriMo---Data-Analysis
An analysis of the data collected from my NaNoWriMo attempts from 2011-2023.

## Background
National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo) is an event that takes place each November. This event gives writers one goal: write a 50,000 word novel in the month of November. It's easy at face value. 50,000 words in 30 days? 1,666 words per day. And if your average typing speed is 60 WPM, you'll finish with only 28 minutes of writing each day.

Like most creative projects: easier said than done. Sometimes the story doesn't more. Some days are more productive than others. People have birthdays you have to celebrate. Lifes get busy. And it turns out there's a major American holiday in November that interferes with writing time.

Since I started undertaking this challenge in 2011, I have "won" NaNoWriMo 14 times. Slightly more Novembers than there are between 2011 and 2024. This is because another event happens in April. Similar rules, but you set your own goal. I stuck with the 50k. I don't try to write a new novel every April, or every November, but I have documented all my 14 attempts. I have the completed novel, and I kept track of how many words written per day.

I am going to analyze this data to determine which day of the week I'm most productive on and how holidays affect my writing productivity.
